# Project Plan

## A visual inspection of Renewable Energy across North and South America
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
This analysis utilizes the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) dataset to carry out a comprehensive visual inspection of the energy deployment across the Americas. Some of the key aspects that will be covered are: Costs, Energy Transition, Capacity and Generation and Investment trends.

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. What are the trends in renewable energy investments in Latin American countries, and how do they compare to fossil fuel investments over the past decade?

2. What is the rate of adoption of renewable energy sources in countries across the Americas, and what factor contributes to differences?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
This project aims to analyze the renewable energy landscape in North and South America using the IRENA dataset. By examining trends in investment, capacity, and generation of renewable energy, we can gain insights into the energy transition in these regions. The analysis will involve visualizations to depict how renewable energy adoption varies by country and region, identifying factors such as government policies, economic conditions, and technological advancements that influence these trends. By comparing renewable energy investments to fossil fuel investments, this project seeks to highlight the evolving dynamics of energy financing and its implications for sustainable development in the Americas.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) is a lead global intergovernmental agency for energy transformation that serves as the principal platform for international cooperation, supports countries in their energy transitions, and provides state of the art data and analyses on technology, innovation, policy, finance and investment. IRENA drives the widespread adoption and sustainable use of all forms of renewable energy, including bioenergy, geothermal, hydropower, ocean, solar and wind energy in the pursuit of sustainable development, energy access, and energy security, for economic and social resilience and prosperity and a climate-proof future.
